# Roblox PNG Visualizer

Small project, uses python and Clonetrooper's PNG library (https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-PNG-Library) to insert images from computer into a Roblox game

- Create a python environment and put main.py in the same directory
- Install ngrok, open it and run ngrok.exe http 7000

You need a host for the web app for it to work in-game, if you're planning to insert an image into studio you can do it with a localhost
you can use ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) not the fastest but it works for a project like this
